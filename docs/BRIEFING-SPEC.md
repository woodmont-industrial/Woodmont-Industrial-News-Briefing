# Woodmont Industrial Partners Daily Industrial News Briefing

## Specification Document

---

## Goal

Produce a concise, scannable daily briefing with **EXACTLY FOUR sections**:

1. **Relevant Articles** — macro trends (rates, inflation, freight, construction inputs, labor) and major industrial real estate news
2. **Transactions** — notable industrial land/building sales or leases
3. **Availabilities** — new/notable industrial land or building availabilities for sale or lease
4. **People News** — personnel moves/promotions within industrial brokerage, development, and investment

---

## Priorities

- **Focus on:** NJ, PA, FL
- Include national context **ONLY** if it informs these markets
- Highlight deals **≥100K SF** or **≥$25M**
- Use credible sources: WSJ, Bloomberg, CoStar, GlobeSt, Bisnow, brokerage research
- Mark "(paywalled)" when applicable

---

## Formatting Rules (Critical)

- Use clear section headings (Relevant Articles, Transactions, Availabilities, People News)
- Start **EACH** bullet item on a **NEW LINE** with a bullet point (•)
- Keep each bullet to **2 lines or fewer** (1-2 sentences maximum)
- Write **4-6 bullets per section** when possible
- Always include: **location + size + key players + terms** (when available)
- End **EVERY** bullet with exactly **ONE action tag**: `[Track]` or `[Share]` or `[Ignore]`
- Include the word "Source" in each bullet for downstream linking
